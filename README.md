# Natural Language Processing with Python for SEOs

A knowledge graph is a type of database that stores information as a network of connected nodes, where each node represents a concept or entity and the edges represent the relationships between them. SEOs (Search Engine Optimizers) use knowledge graphs to help search engines better understand the context and meaning behind the content on a website. This makes search results more informative, visually appealing, and relevant, leading to increased traffic and user engagement.

We are going to extract useful facts automatically from SEJ XML sitemaps.
Then pull article headlines from the URLs in the XML sitemaps.
We will extract entities of interest and their relationships from the headlines.
Finally, we will build a powerful knowledge graph and visualize the most popular relationships.

Here is the step by step:

1. We will fetch all SEJ XML sitemaps
2. We will parse the URLs to extract the headlines in their slugs 
3. We will extract entity pairs from the headlines 
4. We will extract corresponding relationships
5. We will build a knowledge graph and a simple form to visualize specific relationships


Below is a picture of the knowledge grapgh we will get;
